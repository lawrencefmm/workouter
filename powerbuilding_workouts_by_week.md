## IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT WEEK 10

_No exercises found in this section._

## If you are not feeling well recovered after completing Week 9 (achy joints, poor sleep, low energy) you should run Week 11 first and then run the Week 10 max testing. If you have accumulated sufficient fatigue from Weeks 7-9, you will likely perform better by running the deload (Week 11) first, and then running the max test week (Week 10) after.

-        Always use a good spotter when attempting max effort lifts
-        Always use safety bars on squat and bench press (in case you have to dump the bar)
-        Do not test maxes (move to Week 11) if you are feeling joint pain
-        Do not test maxes (move to Week 11) if you do not feel properly recovered
-        Do not test maxes (move to Week 11) if you do not have a good spotter
-        Maxes should be done at a 9.5 RPE: It is not necessary to push to the point where you actually fail. I recommend stopping at the point where you don’t think you could get another rep with good form.


What week to run?

-        Run Week 10A if you have mostly bodybuilding and strength goals
-        Run Week 10B only if you have competitive powerlifting goals

_No exercises found in this section._

## MAX TESTING OPTION A: Important! Choose either Week 10A or Week 10B. Do not run both weeks. See Page 88 in the program PDF for suggestions on which week to run.
